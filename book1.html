            <em>Life of Pi</em> is a remarkable story that explores the
            boundaries of human endurance, faith, and storytelling. The novel
            follows Piscine Molitor Patel (Pi), a boy who survives a shipwreck
            and drifts in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger
            named Richard Parker. Yann Martel's masterful narrative takes
            readers on a journey of survival against impossible odds while
            reflecting on themes of spirituality, human connection, and the
            power of belief. This is a novel that's split into three parts, but
            before we can get into the big picture, there's a little note from
            the author that pretty much can be summarized as questioning the
            truth and what really composes a lie or a reality.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            We then begin part one, which starts in the sixties. Our main
            character is Pi, and he's the son of a zoo owner in Pondicherry.
            He's very reflective on the nature of zoos and how they keep animals
            caged, and he also describes how his classmates make fun of his name
            and how he came to be known simply as Pi.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            Pi is obviously a very mathematical name, and explains that. We then
            learn about his experiences with religion, as he meets people of
            different religions and decides to experiment with them all. When he
            is fourteen, he decides he is going to be a Hindu, Christian, and
            Muslim, despite his parents objecting to the fact and everyone
            telling him that you can't be all three at once.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            He also brings up Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger in the zoo; his
            father explains to his brother and he how they are such dangerous
            animals. 1976 hits, and Indira Gandhi declares The Emergency. The
            family decides to leave India for Canada, selling the animals at the
            zoo to places all over the world, whether in Asia or the United
            States. In the summer of 1977, they board a Japanese freighter,
            which is all they can afford while transporting the animals.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            When right outside of Manila, Pi wakes up in the middle of the night
            and leaves behind his family, which is how he survives the ship
            sinking. A sailor picks him up and throws him onto the lifeboat,
            which contains a zebra, Orange Juice the orangutan, a hyena, and
            Richard Parker.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            As the days go on, the animals get more vicious. The hyena kills and
            eats the zebra, and when Orange Juice decides its had enough, she
            attacks the hyena. The hyena overpowers Orange Juice and kills her,
            then Richard Parker, who has been hiding on the boat, goes and kills
            the hyena.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            All that's left on this boat are Pi and Richard Parker. Pi decides
            to make a raft to live on, and he eventually asserts himself as the
            dominant animal on this structure, making Richard Parker submissive.
            Pi slowly goes delirious as they drift along the Pacific Ocean, and
            at one point he's hallucinating and thinks Richard Parker is
            speaking to him. Turns out there's another person on board all this
            time, a French guy, and Richard Parker kills him before the guy eats
            Pi.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            Eventually, they come across a floating island full of meerkats.
            They stay there for a bit, but when Pi realizes the plant life eats
            flesh/meat, he packs up shop and leaves.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            227 days after the ship sinks, the two wash up on Mexico. Richard
            Parker flees into the jungle, and Pi is rescued from some locals.
            Two officials in part three come from the Japanese Ministry of
            Transport to figure out what happened here, and Pi recalls his tale
            from the hospital. They don't believe him, so Pi offers an
            alternative where the zebra is a Taiwanese sailor, the cook is the
            hyena, and Orange Juice is his mother. The cook uses the sailor's
            leg as fish bait, the sailor dies, and the cook kills Pi's mother.
            The cook is then killed by Pi, who eats him.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            The investigators find this fascinating and connect the dots between
            the animals and Pi's story. Pi says neither can be proven as right,
            but the cause of the shipwreck is unknown. He asks them what story
            they prefer, then thanks them. The investigators file a report with
            the first story.
          </p>
          <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
          <p class="review-text">
            This is an extremely philosophical novel, and there are a lot of
            dimensions to it when it comes to understanding how this impacts the
            viewing of the story and its themes.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            Pi obviously is not a “normal” kid from the way he names himself
            after an abstract math concept and then subscribes to three
            different religions at once (I use normal lightly here, because
            nothing truly ever is normal), and his reflections show that strange
            level of maturity.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            I think there's a lot to take away from this book though in our own
            lives, especially when we consider the stories we tell ourselves and
            what makes them true.
          </p>
          <p class="review-text">
            We also take a good while before we even get to the shipwreck and
            what the novel is best known for, but we need that context to have
            the novel make such an impact.
